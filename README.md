# DevSecOps Pipeline for Python Projects

This repository contains a simple DevSecOps pipeline for Python projects. The pipeline includes stages for linting, testing, static code analysis, dependency scanning, container scanning, and notification of security findings.

## Files

### example_code.py

This file contains a simple Python code that simulates checking the status of a system or service. It includes a `check_status()` function that returns a status string.

### devsecops_pipeline.py

This script represents the DevSecOps pipeline. It performs the following stages:

1. **Linting**: Uses Flake8 to lint the Python code.
2. **Unit Testing**: Runs pytest to execute unit tests.
3. **Static Code Analysis**: Utilizes Bandit to perform static code analysis for security vulnerabilities.
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Employs Safety to check for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
5. **Container Scanning**: Uses Trivy to scan the Docker image for security vulnerabilities.
6. **Notification**: Sends email notifications if any security issues are found during the pipeline execution.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AliGouda611/DevSecOps-Automation-Script.git
cd DevSecOps-Automation-Script




2. Ensure you have the necessary tools installed:

   - Flake8: `pip install flake8`
   - Pytest: `pip install pytest`
   - Bandit: `pip install bandit`
   - Safety: `pip install safety`
   - Trivy: Follow the instructions on [Trivy's GitHub page](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) to install Trivy.

3. Update the Docker image name in `devsecops_pipeline.py` with your actual Docker image name.

4. Configure the email settings in the `send_notification` function in `devsecops_pipeline.py`.

5. Run the DevSecOps pipeline:
