# DevSecOps Pipeline Overview

This Python script implements a simplified DevSecOps pipeline. The pipeline incorporates various security checks into the software development and deployment process to ensure that security is considered at every stage. Below is an overview of what the code does:

## Components:

1. **Linting Code (`lint_code()`):**
   - Uses Flake8 to perform linting on a Python file named "example_code.py".
   - Flake8 checks Python code for style and programming errors.

2. **Running Unit Tests (`run_unit_tests()`):**
   - Executes unit tests located in the "tests" directory using pytest.
   - Pytest is a testing framework for Python.

3. **Running Static Analysis (`run_static_analysis()`):**
   - Performs static code analysis using Bandit.
   - Bandit identifies common security issues in Python code.

4. **Running Dependency Scanning (`run_dependency_scanning()`):**
   - Checks for known security vulnerabilities in project dependencies using Safety.

5. **Running Container Scanning (`run_container_scanning()`):**
   - Scans a Docker image named "your_docker_image" for vulnerabilities using Trivy.
   - Trivy is a vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts.

6. **Sending Notification (`send_notification(subject, body)`):**
   - Sends an email notification using SMTP.
   - Constructs an email message with a specified subject and body, and sends it to a recipient email address.

7. **Setup Logging (`setup_logging()`):**
   - Configures logging to write log messages to a file named "devsecops.log" at the INFO level.

## Main Function (`main()`):
   - Initiates the DevSecOps pipeline by calling various functions.
   - Checks for security issues and sends a notification email if any issues are found.
   - Logs the completion of the DevSecOps pipeline.

## Execution:
   - The `main()` function is executed when the script is run as the main program.

## Usage:
   - This script can be integrated into a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate security checks during the software development and deployment process.
